\section*{Bernie Who?}

% http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/populist-bernie-sanders-running-democrat-challenging-hillary-clinton
Bernie Sanders is a Democrat candidate for President.  As a US Senator
for the last twenty-odd years, he has always run as an Independent
because he thinks the Democrats rely too much on corporate interests
and don't side with average Americans the way they did in, say,
President Roosevelt's time.  He's decided to run as a Democrat because
it will avoid some of the problems with Ralph Nader's 2000 campaign,
but that hasn't changed his social values one bit, and just by running
he has ensured that this race will not be ``politics as usual.''  His
philosophy is

{\large\bf
\begin{quote}
``When you stand up for people and you keep your promise, people will in fact get involved in politics.''
\end{quote}
}

Who does he want to stand up for?  {\bf People like you.}  In his home
state of Vermont he has repeatedly defeated politicians from both
parties who have taken large corporate donations.  {\bf He campaigns
  on issues which benefit the lives of huge numbers of people, like
  you}.  This leaves him unpopular with big corporate donors but keeps
his campaigns cheap -- you don't need a big marketing budget when
you're giving people what they want.  He's following the same strategy
in his campaign for for the Presidency.

%http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-campaign.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&assetType=nyt_now
The benefits of this approach {\bf for you} are obvious.  Of the top
ten organizations associated with donations to Sanders, all are
dedicated to protecting the little guy: nine are unions and one
represents trial lawyers.  The list for Hillary Clinton, the
``presumptive Democratic presidential nominee'' according to
establishment commentary, {\bf contains five banks, two corporate law
  firms, and two cable companies.}  Any politician who tells you a
large donation comes with no obligations is lying to you of course, so
who would you trust to look out for {\bf your} interests?

When you look at this list, it's hard not to conclude that a Clinton
Presidency will involve more sweetheart deals for Wall Street and
other corporate interests, while a Sanders Presidency will strengthen
protections for people like {\bf you} from corporate predation.

\section*{Bernie's Message}

\subsection*{Reducing Income \& Wealth Inequality}

Not so long ago, most families survived on a single middle-class
income.  Since then there have been massive productivity gains from
technology and the majority of women entering the workforce.  And yet,
{\bf many people in the US these days have to work multiple jobs just
  to stay afloat!}  So where is all the wealth from this extra
productivity going?  Straight to the top!  US corporations avoid
paying taxes by stashing their profits off-shore and {\bf a single
  family, the owners of Walmart, has more wealth than the the poorest
  40\% of Americans combined.}

The obvious policies for fixing this are dismissed as ``extreme'' or
``crazy'' by America's political elite, but they do have historical
precedent in the US and were extremely successful back then.  As
Bernie says:

\begin{quote}
{\bf\large ``When `radical socialist' Dwight D. Eisenhower was president
  I think the highest marginal tax rate was something like 90
  percent.''}
\end{quote} 

Bernie's voting record shows that he has long been committed to
reversing this trend.  Some of the policies Bernie would implement to
fix this are:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Raising the minimum wage} and expanding social security.

\item {\bf Repairing US infrastructure} as part of a trillion dollar
  jobs program.

\item {\bf Free College Tuition,} paid for by imposing a small tax on
  extremely large financial transactions, bringing an end to crippling
  student debt.

\item {\bf Universal health care,} bringing an end to crippling
  medical bills.

\item {\bf Resisting elitist trade agreements}, to make it harder for
  US corporations to abandon their American employees by pitting them
  against highly exploitable Third World workers in unwinnable bidding
  wars.

\end{itemize}

Even if you have a job you like with good health care and enough money
to put your kids through college without saddling them with enormous
debt, {\bf the policies just listed will benefit you.}  Most of them
will have a huge stimulatory effect on the economy as regular people
experience it, because it's putting money in the pockets of people who
will spend it.  The policies are what should have happened after the
2008 crisis, but instead the money was given to enormous investment
banks who have given almost nothing back to the real economy.  (By the
way, Bernie wants to break these banks up and audit the Federal
Reserve.)

\subsection*{Getting Big Money Out of Politics}

Of course the reason 2008 worked out that way is that {\bf most big
  policy decisions are determined largely undemocratically, and
  heavily influenced by some politician being given access to huge
  sums of money.}  This is a huge incentive for politicians to serve
the interests of the wealthy at the expense of everybody else.  The
problem has only worsened since the \emph{Citizen's United} ruling
allowed corporations to spend as much as they want on political
advertising.

Bernie is only going to appoint Supreme Court Justices who publically
commit to overturning \emph{Citizen's United}, and he has introduced a
constitutional amendment which would also overturn it.  He will also
provide federal public election funding to wipe out the huge electoral
advantage a politician gains by toadying to corporate interests.

% http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/05/19/today-in-politics-clinton-says-citizens-united-would-guide-her-supreme-court-picks/
Since Bernie has made these commitments, Hillary Clinton has also
stated that she will ``do everything she can to appoint Supreme Court
justices who protect the right to vote and do not protect the right of
billionaires to buy elections.''  Good for her, but this is not a firm
or specific commitment like Bernie has made, and her position on this
is severely compromised by her campaign finance strategy.  {\bf She
  expects to raise \$2.5 billion for her campaign, and intends to do
  it by taking significant corporate donations.}  In contrast, Bernie
expects to spend about \$50 million on the campaign, and raise it
through millions of small donations from people like you.

\subsection*{Civil Rights}

% http://www.democraticunderground.com/10026741056
Bernie's history of supporting civil rights for women, minorities and
LGBT people goes back to the sixties, and reflects his concern for the
welfare of all of his constituents.
% https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/s182/text
He is committed to affirmative action for women and minorities, and to
the principle of ``Equal Pay For Equal Work,'' having co-sponsored
Hillary Clinton's ``Paycheck
% http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Bernie_Sanders_Civil_Rights.htm
Fairness Act.''  He has been given a rating of 97\% by the NAACP, and
co-sponsored a bill recognizing ``Juneteenth''
% http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/05/15/sanders-touts-lgbt-record-in-white-house-bid/
as the end of slavery.  He voted against prohibitions on same-sex
marriage and adoption by same-sex couples, and voted for enforcement
against anti-gay discrimination in schools.  He supports amending the
Civil Rights Act and Fair Housing Act to prohibit discrimination based
on sexual orientation and gender identity.

% http://time.com/3850839/bernie-sanders-usa-patriot-act/
He is also {\bf extremely concerned about the abusive surveillance
  being carried out by US intelligence and law enforcement agencies,
  and wants to put a stop to it.}  Because these agencies are under
the President's direct command as part of the Executive Branch, if he
wins he could make at least 95\% of this surveillance illegal with the
stroke of a pen, though it's worth noting that historically these
agencies have not abided by such decrees if they could get away with
it.  He voted against the PATRIOT act every time, whereas Hillary
Clinton voted for the act in 2001.

\subsection*{Security}
% This is the best page, generally
% http://www.ontheissues.org/Bernie_Sanders.htm#War_+_Peace
% http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/bernie-sanders-troubling-history-supporting-us-military-violence-abroad
Bernie voted against the Iraq War and led efforts to resist it, which
speaks well of his foreign policy judgement compared to Hillary
Clinton, who voted in favor of the war and now regrets doing so.  He
is generally against putting US ``boots on the ground'' in combat
situations, but in favor of a strong military and occasional
intervention in foreign affairs when it suits US or humanitarian
interests.

\subsection*{Climate Change}

Bernie's voting record consistently favors preventing and planning for
global warming, and reducing and regulating energy and greenhouse
emissions.

\section*{Bernie Can Beat the Republicans}

If Bernie is elected as the Democrat presidential nominee, he will be
a shoo-in against the Republican candidate in the general election.
His campaign for the Democrat nomination is a test of the electoral
system.  {\bf A win will indicate whether policies which
  genuinely benefit the vast majority of people can win against mass
  manipulation using enormous public relations and advertising
  budgets.}  Since the Republicans are even more dependent on cynical
manipulation than the Democrats, winning the nomination will mean
Bernie can win the Presidency.

\section*{Why Are You Telling Me This Now?}

Bernie's is not planning to buy many TV ads or spectacles for the news
to cover.  His campaign will depend much more on genuine human
connections between people like you and those they talk to about his
campaign in real life and online because they're personally excited
about his policies.  This is an old-fashioned approach to campaigning,
and it's slower than what we're used to today.

A network of authentic relationships between millions of Bernie
supporters will take time to develop, and there is relatively little
time left until the presidential primaries (the Ohio primary is on
March 15, and the deadline for registering to vote in it is February
14.)

\section*{What Will It Take For Bernie To Win?}

If millions of people like you reach out to pass along Bernie's
message, we all win.  This pamphlet was created to in order to reach
out to you in just that way.
